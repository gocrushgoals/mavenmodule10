# SVG Logo Maker

Application to create a simple and quick .SVG logo

## Description
This is a command line application that prompts a user to answer a few short questions to create a simple business logo with three characters and a choice of three shapes: circle, square, and triangle. The application uses node js with the inquirer package. The functionality is tested with Jest. 


## Inspiration

This logo maker was inspired by the creation of new business logos 
I was motivated by the interest in ease and simplicity of the application to create a logo image
This project was built to streamline and simplify the creation of buisiness logos through the use of a few short question prompts. 
This solves a problem of many buisnesses looking for a quick and simple logo
